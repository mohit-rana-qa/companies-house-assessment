# Companies House â€“ Practical Automation Assessment
[Playwright+TS] and [Selenium 4 + Java 21] suites targeting https://automationintesting.online with UI, API, a11y, visual and tiny perf smoke. See /docs for plan & bugs.

## Playwright
```bash
cd playwright-ts
npm ci
npx playwright install --with-deps
npm test
```
## Selenium
```bash
cd selenium-java
mvn -q -DskipTests=false test
```

## Test Plan Summary
See [docs/TEST_PLAN.md](docs/TEST_PLAN.md) for the complete plan.

**Scope:**
- Verify booking flow, contact form, admin login, and room creation.
- Validate core REST APIs (`/room`, `/booking`, `/actuator/health`).
- Include non-functional checks: accessibility (Axe), visual snapshots, performance smoke.

**Test Types:**
- `@smoke` â€“ Happy-path UI checks
- `@api` â€“ API contract/smoke tests
- `@a11y` â€“ Accessibility scans
- `@visual` â€“ Visual regression baselines
